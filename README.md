You need to make a fork of this repository, and replace your name in the list below with your github, following this format:

[**@username**]() Something about you

For example:
      
> [**@harrig12**](https://github.com/harrig12) My favourite food is pancakes and I like running 🏃‍♀️ my research is about using machine learning to understand cancer <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23587234?s=400&u=ea93fb16bd1f0b9c3f1e0e420136e4a1919daff3&v=4" alt="a picture of me" width="40px"> 

You can grab the image of your profile picture from your github account. Like any other markdown document, you can add links, images, even emojis 🍋🍰🐸 

This is the code I used for writing that line:

```md

```
