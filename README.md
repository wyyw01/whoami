You need to make a fork of this repository, and replace your name in the list below with your github, following this format:

[**@username**]() Something about you

For example:

> [**@mjmoon**](https://github.com/mjmoon) My guilty pleasures nowadays is listening to female K-pop groups 🎵 I study and teach statistics. <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18671161?s=400&v=4" alt="A side headshot photo in black and white of Michael" width="60px">  


You can grab the image of your profile picture from your github account. Like any other markdown document, you can add links, images, even emojis 🍋🍰🐸

This is the code I used for writing that line:

```md

```

Once you are done, submit a Pull Request to include your information in the original repository.
